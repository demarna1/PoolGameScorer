        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p><b>Name</b>: Average Finish</p>
        <p><b>Short Description</b>: Knockout-style game over multiple rounds.</p>
        <p><b>Number of Players</b>: This game can support 2-15 players. It is ideal for 3-8 players.</p>
        <h3>Setup</h3>
        <p>
            For each round, the numbers 1-15 must be issued
            to each player. There are two ways to do this:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Texting</b> - When starting a New Game, check the box to "Send Texts". At
                    the start of each round, numbers will be texted to each player. Note: all
                    players must be in your contact list.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Manually</b>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Write the numbers 1-15 on pieces of paper.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For the first round only, distribute the pieces evenly among
                            players.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Ex: There are 5 players. Each player gets three numbers in
                                    Round 1.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Ex: There are 6 players. Each player gets two numbers in
                                    Round 1. The 3 extra numbers are kept hidden.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            For all remaining rounds, distribute any extra pieces in reverse
                            order of finish.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Ex: There are 6 players. Players who finished 1-3 in the
                                    previous round get 2 numbers. Players who finished 4-6 in
                                    the previous round get 3 numbers.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Lag to determine initial order of play.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each player keeps their numbers hidden and attempts to pocket the other player's
                numbered balls. The game is styled like knockout. When a player's numbered balls
                have been pocketed, that player <b>must</b> announce that they have been knocked
                out.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        If a player pockets their own ball, they may continue their turn unless this
                        has resulted in the player being knocked out.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                When a player has been knocked out, mark their position of finish in the app.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <b>Ex</b>: There are 6 players. Last place should be marked with a "6".
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                The round continues until there is one player remaining. When all positions have
                been entered, click "Add Round" to confirm the round.
            </li>
            <li>
                The order of the next round is determined by the results of the previous round, with
                the winner breaking, and so on.
            </li>
            <li>
                The game continues for subsequent rounds and the app will track the
                <i>average finish</i> of players. It is often desired to agree upon a set number of
                rounds at the start of the game. The player with the best <i>average finish</i>
                after X rounds is declared the winner.
